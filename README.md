# The-Nifty-50-Stock-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the next day's opening price of Nifty 50 stocks. The model employs a Random Forest Regressor to analyze historical stock data and generate accurate predictions, providing valuable insights for traders and investors.

**Key Features:**

1.  **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
    
    -   Data Sources: Collected historical stock data from reliable financial databases and sources.
        
    -   Cleaning: Conducted data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
        
    -   Feature Engineering: Created relevant features such as previous day's opening, closing, high, low prices, and trading volume.
        
2.  **Model Selection and Training:**
    
    -   Algorithm: Utilized the Random Forest Regressor from Scikit-Learn, an ensemble learning method that aggregates multiple decision trees to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting.
        
    -   Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. Trained the model on the training set and fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize results.
        
3.  **Evaluation:**
    
    -   Metrics: Used Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) as primary metrics for evaluating the model's performance.
        
    -   Results: The model achieved high accuracy in predicting the opening stock prices, showing a strong correlation between predicted and actual values.
        

**Technologies and Tools:**

-   Programming Language: Python
    
-   Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
